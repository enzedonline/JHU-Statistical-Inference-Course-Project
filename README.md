# JHU-Statistical-Inference-Course-Project

Final assessment project for the John Hopkin's University Statistical Inference course, the 6th in the Data Science Specialization.

Part 1 is a basic analysis to demonstrate the central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of the mean, distribution of sample means from many samples, is nearly normal centred at the population mean, with standard error equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.

This demonstration shows how taking sufficient samples from the exponential distribution will  
produce means whose distribution approximate the normal distribution.

Part 2 is a basic demonstration of making inferences from small data sets. Using R's ToothGrowth dataset which represents a study of the effect of Vitamin C on tooth growth in 60 guinea pigs

The report makes use of T-Tests to make conclusions about relationships between tooth growth, supplement type and dosage level.
